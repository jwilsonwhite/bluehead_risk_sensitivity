Data and code associated with Bogdan et al. paper in Ethology (currently in review)

The included R scripts execute all of the analyses reported in the paper, and produce all of the figures.

There are separate scripts for the stomach content analysis and the otolith analysis. Each script is associated with its own data file (Guts+Otos.csv or Master_otolith_data.csv).

Both R scripts contain various bespoke 'helper' functions, mostly to make the plots. They appear at the end of each file. Run those first to enter them into the workspace.
